# React Project Initialization Script with Tailwind CSS

This Bash script automates the process of creating a new React project with Tailwind CSS integration. It streamlines the setup by performing various tasks, making it easier to start building your React applications with the power of Tailwind CSS.

## How It Works

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine or downloading the script file `script.sh`.

2. **Navigate to the Script Location**: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the `script.sh` script is located.

3. **Make the Script Executable**: Ensure the script has executable permissions by running the following command:

   ```bash
   chmod +x script.sh
  ```
4. **Run the Script**: Execute the script by providing the desired name for your React project as an argument. For instance, to create a project named "my-awesome-app," run:
```bash
  script.sh my-awesome-app
```
**Replace my-awesome-app with your chosen project name.**

## How to make this script global
